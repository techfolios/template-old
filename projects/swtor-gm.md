As I transitioned from the submarine work schedule of 90+ hours a week to civilian life, I became a frequent gamer on the new Star Wars MMO.  It was a way to spend time working together with others to accomplish common goals, albeit repeatedly defeating digital enemies.  It became more than just a game, as I made dozens of friends adventuring across the fictional Star Wars Universe.  Before I knew it, our grandmaster was stepping down and handed me the reins to our thriving guild of several hundred people.

I took the responsibility very seriously, and immediately set out with several goals: to help guildmates succeed with their in-game goals, to foster success of our guild overall, and to make sure we had a welcoming friendly environment with a minimum of drama.  Perhaps surprisingly, the last was the most difficult.  Over the next few months my own gameplay took a backseat as I spent most time in-game addressing and solving guild problems while monitoring the in-game auction house, even gaining the assistance of several guild officers I could delegate tasks to for which they were better suited.  I also took on the responsibility of raid leader and main tank to maximize our chances for good loot, despite my preference to take a more casual role and to play a stealth/dps/healer class.  However, the sacifices were well worth it, as our guild expanded and thrived.

As time went on, the game began to feel more and more like a second job, albeit an entertaining one I could spend while enjoying endless banter with my online friends.  However, I had decided to dedicate that large chunk of time to personal habits with more significant long-term benefits.  That being said, I wanted to leave my friends in the best position possible.  I spoke with my friends in-game outside the guild, and found two other guilds who were willing to merge.  This was a huge deal at the time, as the new guild spaceships could only be fully utilized by guilds with massive funding.  Despite many objections, setbacks, and close-calls, we were able to negotiate a merger into a super-guild, complete with a new name all current guildmasters and officers were satisfied with.  Ultimately, I was able to assist in making the leisure time of several hundred people across the world significantly more efficient and enjoyable.

I learned several important lessons from this experience.  First, I am willing to expend much effort and sacrifices to make the future more efficient and enjoyable for those I care about.  Secondly, I had much more capabiity as a teammate and leader than I had ever thought possible--I was in charge of many subordinates in the military, but it's a bit different when their paycheck and quality of life depends on following your orders.  Lastly, the time requirements of an MMO are incompatible with the life goals I have: being physically, mentally, and emotionally healthy; developing skills and experience to create challenging yet rewarding projects; and working as hard as necessary to help our world a better place for everyone, now and in the future.
