This is the YouTube Channel for my ICS111 course, and there were three 
projects I did in ICS111. my professor let us to upload project to YouTube 
because people can see what we did, and this is the chance to let 
people discover me. I totally agree with that, so I will keep doing this.

So far, I only had three project in my YouTube channel, and these projects
are made with EZ Graphics and some basic Java skills. EZ Graphic is a 
multimedia library designed to make it easier for novice programmers
to quickly build Java applications that incorporate graphics and sound.
Since I didnt have any Java experience at that time. Therefore, those 
three projects were kind of silly. However, I will upload more when I become 
a good programmer.
