summary: The first project in C for ICS 212.
---
This was my first project in C. There are two files that handle seperate things. Database.c handles the linked list of records, while menu.c handles all user interface. The records will hold the persons name, account number, address and year of birth. The user can add, delete, and change accounts. The list can hold as many records as needed and was listed numberically by account number.  

This was the first time I was learning C and I am really proud of this first project that I made. For this class, we were just given assignments to practice coding in C so I was learning how to code as I was taking on assignments. So for this project I did not know a lot about C but I managed my time well, and was able to turn this project in early and still get a great grade for it.
