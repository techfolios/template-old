This project was pretty much the first project of my computer science career. It took place over three quarters of the semester as we were instructed to turn in certain milestones for the first three quarters of the semester. The project is able to grab any of the four stickers, continually paste them onto the background picture anywhere below the line, and right click any picture on the canvas to delete it. It is also able to save whatever is currently on the canvas to a .txt file and is able to load that text file whenever it is needed. Although it is definitely not a masterpiece by any means, I was very proud when I completed it!

In this project, I was working alone, although I had the help of my TA to put it together, as I was still quite new at making Code.

Although it wasn’t a very stunning accomplishment, I believed that this project was important in helping me understand what I wanted to be in the future. This was one of the first things I had ever created. My drawing/crafting skills are terrible and I had seen that with the power of a text editor, I could make things I could be proud of too. This project was an important milestone in helping me realize that programming things is something that I could wake up every morning and look forward to doing.
