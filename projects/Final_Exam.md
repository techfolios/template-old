summary: Final web app for my ICS-314 software engineering project.
---

Avalunch is the brain-child of ICS 314 classmates, Anh Lam @anhlam, Edmund Ho @sorazodia, and Clark DeNunzio @unjammy. Our software aims to become the visual solution to the problem of contemplating meal decisions during students precious lunch breaks. At first glace, our application provided the following landing page to explain our product. The application is a simple display for different food vendors on campus and the additional input that users can manipulate is adding thier favorite food items. This project heavily relied on Meteor, HTML, Javascript, CSS and Mongo DB. The final product is available by using Galaxy to deploy Avalunch here [here](http://avalunch.meteorapp.com/).

## Contribution

I had the idea of making SVGs as a user interface. This strike out to me because I saw animations on different websites using Jquery or bootstraps to make the site more dynamic and fun. I had some designs and played around with the animation. I made the menu, the homepage, the about page and the layout of the pages for the restaurants.

I learn more about JavaScript because I had to find ways to manipulate the animation with the SVG and making the site a lively showcase was very fun. I had a hard time with the database and routing everything got easier in the end.
