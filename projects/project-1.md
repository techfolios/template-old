summary: My team developed a small prototype on a mobile app that linked players together
---

For our final project in ICS464, my team had decided on creating a Tinder-like app except for gamers. Instead of searching for romance, our app was designed for players to look for other skilled players in their area so that they could form a competitive team. Due to time constraints, we were only ever able to create an extremely rough program that didn't run while our final vision was left as a paper prototype.
