                    Cholera, pronounced as kol-er-uh, is an intestinal disease that can result in death within the first few
                    hours after the first symptoms appear, which includes vomiting and idarrhea. At the time of the outbreak, it
                    was believed that cholera was caused by breathing in miasma in the atmosphere, which included things such as
                    germs, pollutants, and "bad smells."

                    It wasn't until 1854 where John Snow, a british doctor studing this disease, could prove that the disease was
                    spreadable by drinking water contaminated by their septic system. In 1854, a mother washed her baby's diaper in
                    a town well and it sparked an epidemic that killed 616 people. The following visualizations shows information  regarding this epidemic.
