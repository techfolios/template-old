Hi guys! My name is Melissa Yago and like in my bio, I am a MIS, accounting and finance major. I know it sounds crazy to take on all these majors but the reason why I do it is because I want to challenge myself and have taken a peculiar interest in all three. However, if I had to choose a favorite major at the moment, it would be MIS. The reason being that in my little experience of coding, I have felt the immense satisfaction of being able to tell the computer what I want to get done. And seeing the potential of what you can do through coding gets me excited. It’s only a matter of learning the basics and continuous practice until you start to fully understand. I look forward to taking ITM and working with you all!

Outside of academics, one thing that I love to do when I have the opportunity is travel. Last semester, I came back from a study abroad at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and all I can say is that I wish I was back there! Imagine Hawaii except bigger, much more preserved in terms of their natural environment and four actual seasons. It was such a beautiful country and the best part I would say are the friends I’ve made along the way! Prior to New Zealand, I also studied abroad in Japan for a month taking language courses. Despite it being tough, being in that class was the eye opener that the level of intelligence out there is insane from students that come from all over the world. From that day forward, I’ve always strived to learn as much as I can and make room for improvement! Next year though, I hope to study abroad once more in Korea! Being able to experience different cultures and forcing myself to be out of my comfort zone truly ingrains into you lots of life lessons!

Job wise, I have worked in a lot of different places. I started off in the military, decided for the best of my interest that it wasn’t for me so I came back to UH. From freshman year forward, I’ve worked at the Lyon Arboretum, interned at a property management firm and currently work at the Hawaii Space Grant Consortium. Each experience has truly changed me and this school year, I am doing my best to find a position that really focuses in on one of my majors. I need all the experience I can get to get my career going once I graduate!    

Aside from that, thanks for taking the time to read this essay! I look forward to taking ITM and working with you all!
