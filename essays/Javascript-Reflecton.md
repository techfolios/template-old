## Java, my first love

When I was first in my introductory class to computer science, Java was the most amazing programming language in the world. Of course, it was the only programming language that I knew. I was using Java to learn all the basic concepts like syntax, errors, objects, data types and many more. It was fun and exciting and the language was easy to read. I was using Java when I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in computer science. I was in love with programming and Java!

## Then came C

Once I started learning C, I realized Java babied me when programming. Java is still a great program but it hid a lot of the underlying concepts in programming. I had no idea what pointers, addresses or references was. I respect C for making me understand what exactly is happening in my program because if you did not understand what was happening it would not even run.

## Now there is JavaScript
I have not used too much of JavaScript to say that it is my favorite programming language but I like what I see so far. A lot of the code I have written with JavaScript is straight forward. I can assign variables without defining what specific type it is, I can add different types of variables into an array and I can create objects in an array. It feels like I am riding a wave as I write with JavaScript! In a software engineering perspective, JavaScript is great since it goes well with HTML and CSS. 

## WODs

A WOD is a daily exercise that strengthens a specific skill and it stands for “Work Out of the Day”. A WOD is suppose challenge one’s self and should push the person to their limits. Using a WOD to practice programming is a great technique. It exposes a person to constant stress that allows for that person to learn how to adapt under many circumstances. It is just like working out a muscle. If one starts lifting for the very first time 10 lbs. my feel heavy but as they keep lifting weights 10 lbs. becomes light and soon they will be able to lift 50 lbs. easily. As I practice daily WODs with using a new programming language to me, JavaScript, I believe I can become a strong Software Engineer.
