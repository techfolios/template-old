1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways
    - I actually understand what I’m doing. Before, the labs were kinda just follow along and it wasn’t too difficult to comprehend. When we got into functions— wow, I cried. That was so hard. The else if was just a super confusing concept for me. But over time I understood. I used to look at old code and be in amazement that someone actually understood what it meant. I’m happy that I can kinda say I do too now.
2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
    - Doing stuff on my own and rewatch screencasts. For Assignment 1, I had no idea where to start, luckily a screencast was sent out but still, I want to be able to know what I’m doing before I get guidance. 
3. I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.
    - Eh, sorta. I know along the lines of what to do. I try it myself first but I don’t record it. I’m just really slow. I read over the prompt like 3 times before I do anything to make sure I’m doing what it asks. For the most part, I can do the basics but when I get stuck, I watch the screencast. After I’m walked through, I go back to doing it on my own. I’d like to be faster and more confident.
4. The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
    - YES. Rick is great teacher! I record every lab and rewatch them when filling and submitting the Labs. It does take me some time to complete the lab just because I don’t fill it out during class. I don’t like to because I’m afraid that if I fill out the question, I’ll miss something super important and hold back the class.
5. I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1).
    - Yes! Assignment 1 was difficult because my server just wasn’t working. I did it myself with the screencast and nothing. I looked at others class-members codes, nothing. I rewatched the screencast and made my code identical to Dan’s server, nope. I made my notes so I knew what each function was doing, nope. I reached out to Rick and he did help! I work all day on weekends so unfortunately I wasn’t able to submit it on time. However, with his help I was able to adjust my code and boom, it worked! I don’t know why it didn’t work on my local host tho. I kept having to reload the class server and try out there. Kinda strange.
6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
    - I’m not too sure, I’s scary to think this class used to be in person. I feel like it’s a lot better conducted through online. I say this because when someones code isn’t working, they’re able to screen share and the whole class can help figure out where the code is going wrong. I think it’s beneficial because if we have similar problems outside of class, we’ll know what to look for when debugging.
7. These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:
    - Recording of lectures and walking through the labs. I like looking back and confirming what I’m doing is correct. This was also super helpful when completing the first couple WODs.
