## Overview
Now a days with UH students email inbox getting flooded with career oppurtunities, misellaneous announcement extra curricular activities and school events. The problem with that is that the information is not automatically filter according to students interest. The students would have to maunally set their own filtering system to sort these mails, and often time - they would rather not spend time doing that.  
Solutions: The NAME APP would allows users to sign up as members of the school community and also be involve in career job oppurtunities. This would make things easier for employers to post job or internship availibility and all students can both be inform and at the same time be able to filter information according to thier interests. This would promote more colaboration and exposure for students seeking career oppurtunities.

## Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:

Public Landing page
Login page
User home page
Admin home page
User profile page includes Resume/ Cover Letter 
Job/ Internship available right now page
Recent update on companies postings 
Resources for interview or career tips 

## Use case ideas

New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile and upload resume and or cover letter. 
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
User goes to landing page, logs in, looks for job openings and from which companies.
User is notified of daily job postings that match their preferences

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

Automated updating of menu items. Determine which vendors have specials, and ask them to post them online. Then add functionality to the system to retrieve that data.
Allow students to rate menu items.
Integrated map functionality; note that some food trucks change their location over the course of a week.
