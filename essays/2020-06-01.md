## This is my first post. The Date Today is June 1st 2020


This is my first post. At the end of last year 2019. I decided to delete my git hub and bit bucket repositories and start afresh in terms of developing software projects. When I started developing software around 2013 I did it to build a business USA2Kenya. The site was built n Ruby on Rails and I learnt a lot through that whole process. After the company I started working for different companies and though this process. I felt that as  self taught software developer  I missed a lot of the principles of software development. As the saying goes the more you learn the more you realize what you do not know.So this blog is a journey back into my life a software developer starting “afresh” and hopefully building new and exciting projects
