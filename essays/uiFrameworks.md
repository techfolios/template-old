# Semantic UI Frameworks

I'm not sure if it was the addition of UI Frameworks, but after getting some experience with them, my HTML and CSS coding just clicked. Well, the basics at least.  When I was first introduced to HTML it seemed so foreign.  The numerous div tags were overwhelming, and I guess I just didn't grasp the idea that HTML is more focused on cosmetics than languages I've learned before.  Seeing how the containers interact with different kinds of elements finally made me realize the design potential in HTML.

Having never used any kind of UI Framework before, I found that using Semantic UI was a positive experience. I love that the documentation on it was so well done.  Just about every question I had could be solved by googling "Semantic ui *problem*".  The examples were clear and the source code provided by the semantic ui website could easily be adapted to fit my needs.  While I still have issues getting things aligned exactly how I need them, the framework made the process significantly easier, especially with how I visualize the code in my head.  Overall, I have no complaints.  In a matter of weeks, I went from knowing absolutely nothing about web design, to being able to mimic everyday websites.

Here are some of the websites I re-created with Semantic UI.  It's rough, but I'm learning and getting better!
