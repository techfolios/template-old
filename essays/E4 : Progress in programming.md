My programming skills have greatly improved.
I am enthusiastic about programming.
I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.
The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).
I think the class can be improved to help my learning.
There are things that work really well my learning in this class.
