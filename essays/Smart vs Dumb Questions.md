## ONLINE PRESENCE TODAY:

The Internet has become ingrained into all of our daily lives. Virtually everyone has some sort of online presence. It is important to keep
a positive image of oneself online for obvious reasons. A part of this is knowing how to interact with the Internet appropriately and knowing
how to communicate over the Internet in a smart and proper way. Most people use the Internet for information, they use this technology to answer
questions. The Internet has so much knowledge that it comes down to the user knowing how to access that information in an effective and smart way.

## AN UNINTELLIGENT QUESTION:

On StackOverflow, users ask questions in the context of tech or computer science. The use of voting is implemented on the site to reward questions
that are thought-provoking and penalize questions that are deemed worthless.

A particularly bad one that I have found is: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19314079/gives-an-infinite-loop

The title of the question is simply: "Gives an infinite loop". First of all, this title is not even a question, it is a statement. What are browsers
of the site supposed to answer with when they see this question? Are they supposed to confirm that it is an infinite loop? This question is way too vague.
Also there is no context onto what language this is code will be referencing. All in all, this is an absolutely terrible question.

## AN INTELLIGENT QUESTION:

A good example would be: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1143262/what-is-the-difference-between-const-int-const-int-const-and-int-const

This question, "What is the difference between const int*, const int * const, and int const *?" is a great question for a few reasons. First
of all, it is a very specific question. Oftentimes, questions are not smart because they are too generalized and have probably been asked many
times before. The more specific a question, the higher likelihood it has not been answered before, as well as the ability for the question to
attract attention from experts. Experts tend to flock to more specific, esoteric types of questions because they present a challenge to the expert.
Answering such questions gives more gratification than "How do I reverse a string in Java" for example. This question is also great because it opens
doors to other aspects of the language, in this case pointers. Answers can dwelve into pointers and their use, and offer more substance to the 
overall answer to the question.

## CONCLUDING:

Asking good questions is key to learning in life. They say the smartest people are those who ask the most questions. In today's world, we have the
greatest library to ever exist - the Internet. It is easier than ever to obtain information. Knowing how to ask strong online questions will
save a user time and energy (And maybe a HW grade).
