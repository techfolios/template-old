## EXPERIENCE WITH HTML/CSS:

Prior to taking ICS 314, I had no experience with HTML and CSS whatsoever. Now that I have had some exposure to these "programming languages", I am now able to understand how websites are created from the ground up. HTML can be seen as the bones of an animal, while CSS is the superficial skin, hair, make-up, etc that is added on after the main base is set up. After coding for some time in "real" programming languages like C, the HTML and CSS web-browser languages feel more like mere formatting and organizational tools. Even though I feel this way, they still are quite powerful tools that all computer science students should be comfortable using.

## EXPERIENCE WITH SEMANTIC UI:

After being introduced to Semantic UI, a modern front-end development framework, I was initially a bit intimidated. The Semantic UI framework has a lot of built-in features; the amount of options to choose from is staggering and a lot to take in at first. However the more I used it and got accustomed to it, the more I grew to appreciate working with a framework. The Semantic framework does a lot of the work for the programmer. Once the programmer knows what he or she is doing, the programmer is able to create sleek and modern looking websites in under an hour. I myself was able to create a pretty good clone of the Tory Richard website. I also dug a little deeper, and noticed that it is actually possible to put in more advanced web features like [Google Maps using Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/modules/embed.html). Going forward, I would like to see how I can use this code to create an actual website (example: .com, .net, etc). How does this code work with a real webserver? As of the time I am writing this, we have not discussed this in class at all, hopefully we will. All in all, it seems like I am still at the tip of the iceberg in regards to web development, I cannot wait to learn more...
