Hello! My name is Amber and I am majoring in MIS because I thought that it would be interesting to major in. In senior year of high school while looking for possible majors, MIS stuck out to me while I was scrolling through a list of majors and that sparked my interest in the major. So I researched it a bit and decided to give it a shot since nothing else stood out to me at the time.
