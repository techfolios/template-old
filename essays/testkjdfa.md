## Introduction

Prior to ICS314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I had no experience with coding in html. The syntax of html was and still is quite foreign to me. From what I understand, it is kind of like a layout, a blank sheet and each line of code you type in adds elements that can be seen visually in a web page. My initial reaction to html was that it'll take me forever to learn how to make a decent web page, that is until semantic UI was introduced.

## Thoughts

Semantic UI has made creating an astheically pleasing web page within my reach now. Although, there still are some complexities to it, it is, overall, pretty simple. With semantic UI I am able to mimic some web pages, although not perfectly, it is still pretty close. However, I noticed that it seems that semantic UI is limited in what it can do. Its like a tiny toolbox with tools that can be use in a broad fashion but nothing for special tasks.

## Conclusion

I'm not sure how those who have spent years to master and perfect the use of html and css feel about semantic UI. My guess is that it's not well received in that community as it may seem like it's not real web page designing. But, I think there is a place for semantic UI, not everyone has the time, luxury, or even feel the need to learn html to its fullest. However, these people may want to visualize their thoughts so that its easier to show others instead of explaining and can use semantic UI for that purpose.
