My first experience with coding was with a programming language called C. Throughout the courses I have taken in college, the language mainly used was C. I would like to think that since that time, I have become more proficient with C and felt like it was a good time to learn a new language. Luckily, through my ICS314 course I have the opportunity to learn JavaScript. 

As I began learning JavaScript, I thought of it as learning a new language. It can be very difficult at the beginning but as you become familiar with using it and its syntax and toolsets, it becomes second nature. Just like teaching someone something new, you need to be able to communicate properly with the computer so that you can get it to perform the task that you want it to. As I began learning the basics of JavaScript, I felt that it was familiar and similar to what I’ve learned in the past in terms of syntax. On the other hand, I would also say that a difference is that JavaScript has a lot more flexibility as it can handle variables and functions more easily, and the functions can be treated like a variable.

When learning a new language, it is necessary and important to practice using it. Therefore, a good way to do this is by practicing WODs which means “Workout of the Day.” WODs are timed coding exercises, where a coding problem is given that you need to solve within the expected time limit. In the practice WODs that I have done that cover the basics of JavaScript, I would say that so far they have gone well as I have been able to solve the problems within the recommended time. I think the only reason why I might find it stressful is because I’m worried about not being able to solve the problem or get my code to work. I know that I need more practice in order to master coding with JavaScript, but I believe that this style of learning is beneficial because it will sharpen my thinking skills as I process and think about how to solve the problem and create a program that can produce the result that I want it to. I am hoping that the WODs can help me in our future in-class WODs and towards the larger projects and jobs I face in the future.

I think that JavaScript is a good programming language to learn especially for those who are still being introduced to coding. While it is easier to use than C, I think I still need more time to decide whether its flexibility could lead to problems when creating bigger programs. Nonetheless, I look forward to putting these new practices I have learned to good use as I learn how to code in JavaScript.
