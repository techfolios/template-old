Hi everyone, my name is Stacy. I'm a third-year undergraduate with a major in MIS and a minor in Religion. Before I switched over to MIS, I was heavily into finance. I got an internship at a globally-known finance firm, joined a finance academy, and was a board member for the Financial Management Association. As I got into it, it became more unattractive to me. When I sought for a new internship, business technology jobs were the only ones I took of interest. I figured there was no reason to continue my finance degree if I couldn't even find an appealing job. Plus, watching someone code is so crazy. It's like building a child, digitally, of course. So wild to me. So here I am, excited, and determined to learn. :)


Browser History #1: I redid this assignment four times. The first time I read through it I accidently watched the screencast before hand. I thought it was a watch-and-see-if-you-can-remember type thing. I redid it because I wanted to try to reach the Rx level. I had alot of trouble trying to connect my links which meant I kept having to look at my notes but I was still confused. I remembered in the screencast to wrap the text but I completely forgot how! I ended up having to watch the screencast like three times to fully understand it without notes. By my fourth attempt, it ended up being after 12 and I decided to go to bed. I was just over the Rx suggested time! I was so sad lol. When it comes time for review, I'll most likely attempt it again to get in the Rx.

Browser History #2: So fast! On my first attempt, I was able to get everything except the floating. I got Av my first time because I typed out margin-top, margin-bottom, etc. instead of just margin. The screen cast helped me be more effiecent in that way. I used w3schools.com for help. Everything on the site was easy to understand and locate. I 1989327% recommend everyone to pin it to their browser. Other than the margin trouble, my live-server was kinda wonky. I had to refresh manually a couple times which was kinda annoying. But for the most part, easiest lab by far.

BrowserHistory #3: Not half bad. I got Rx within my second attempt. However, it did take me quite a bit of time because my live-server was not wanting to update. I also had this problem in the previous assignment, so I should probably look into that. I used w3schools.com again for this one. I was able to understand the formulas and how to connect them. My lining of the rows was super off, so I thought I did it wrong. In the screencast, this seemed to be a universal problem so it made me feel alot better. The navigation bar really stumpt me. I had a minute left to finish in Rx time and I was like, "Nooo, I'm going to have to do this all over." But luckly I figured it out with 15 seconds to spare! :) Turns out I kept forgeting to put 'px' after the numbers. Rookie mistake haha.
