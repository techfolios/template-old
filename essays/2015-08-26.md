My name is Rianne Pada, and I am a Management Information Systems (MIS) major!

I decided to major in MIS because I was interested in the challenge and have grown to have an interest in software development. I started interning at a software development company called RevaComm, and interning there has made me love technology and software development even more. I simply find it interesting, and love how it functions almost like a puzzle needed to be solved. I love the idea of being able to help people with technology and have a level of knowledge in my company.

When I decided to major in something in business, I originally thought I would go into marketing. But after discovering MIS I changed my mind and wanted to pursue a career in software and technology.
