Hi everyone, my name is Stacy. I'm a third-year undergraduate with a major in MIS and a minor in Religion. Before I switched over to MIS, I was heavily into finance. I got an internship at a globally-known finance firm, joined a finance academy, and was a board member for the Financial Management Association. As I got into it, it became more unattractive to me. When I sought for a new internship, business technology jobs were the only ones I took of interest. I figured there was no reason to continue my finance degree if I couldn't even find an appealing job. Plus, watching someone code is so crazy. It's like building a child, digitally, of course. So wild to me. So here I am, excited, and determined to learn. :)
