## OVERVIEW:

When thinking up an application that could be used to assist UH Manoa in some way, my partner and I thought of a campus repair-related app. We believe that, currently, UH Manoa has no way of organizing or grouping campus repairs into one single source. We are not sure how campus maintenance currently goes about this, but we believe that a webtool or application could greatly help organize their efforts. We will illustrate how this app could be used in practice:

Say a student or faculty member is strolling through campus between classes. This person sees a damaged or suspicious railing, pothole, or something of the like. They use the app to take a photo of the event, and then they write a small caption about the event. Upon upload, the report is also geo-tagged. The app would also have a built-in campus map where dots on the map represent all reports made. If possible, we could implement a feature that does not allow for duplicate reports based on geo-tag similarity. This overall map could be sent to maintenance. Either that, or email notifications could be sent out to maintenance at the time a report is submitted (or even better, both). 

Other than Vandalism or Damage reports, the app could also have Lost & Found functionality. I also think we could use the filter() function to filter reports into these three categories. This would organize reports further and allow users to have an easier time finding what report they wish to view.

Lastly, I think we must implement regular users vs administrator roles. An administrator would have the power to remove reports that have been solved or deemed insignificant. I think administrators could be determined by log-in credentials. I think this would be a beneficial project for the campus.

## LATER THOUGHTS:

After letting this idea sit and brew in my head for a few days, I have realized that it is probably too niche for the entire student/faculty body to utilize. It is unlikely that
a majority of students and faculty will take the time to download and use an app with such situational use. Therefore, I propose that this app be tailor made for the maintanence
faculty only. Maintanence could use a webtool that will help organize and document their tasks. If only the maintanence uses this, the app could be more focused and effective for
that group of people, without losing any of its overall effectiveness because maintanence are the people mainly looking out for campus damages anyway....
Just my two cents.
