However, if I was a complete newbie and coding for the first time, the program wouldnn't provide the necessary help I would I look further i d me through the process either. Part of the fault was due to insufficient instructions.

    The module didn't include object oriented programming but as I look further into the curriculum, there was a section that covers just that. The interface with the user is straight forward. However, if I was a complete newbie and coding for the first time, the program wouldnn't provide the necessary help I would need. There were times when I was stuck on a task and from my perspective, the available resources didn't aid me through the process either. Part of the fault was due to insufficient instructions. Overall, this learning style was self-taught in a sense and after accomplishing the module, it is rewarding since it is another addition for knowledge of another programming language under my skillsets.

    JavaScript, from I have been told, is the language for the future and the bread and butter for web application development. According to reviews from different tech article and developer forums, JavaScript is an extremely marketable language. From national statistics, software development jobs are vastly growing throughout the nation with the demand to become proficient with JavaScript. The language provides variety of resources and tools to support dynamic data structures, object oriented programming for prototyping and functionality that is simple and versatile. Consistency and practice will deepen my knowledge of the language and I know the end product of my future projects will come with ease with JS. I enjoy learning it and welcome the challenge when I take on bigger projects as it will help me become better at what I do.
