\# Asking Smart Questions

Asking smart questions comes down to communication.  The goal of a smart question is to accurately convey a problem so that answers can be returned just as accurately.  Smart questions lead to smart answers that may include more information than was thought necessary, fostering more growth and learning.  When questions are asked poorly, miscommunications happen which means time is lost. It causes frustration for both parties when it is unclear what information is being searched for. Below are two examples of questions, one good and one bad.

\# Smart Question

Here I am referencing a question posted to Stack Exchange titled, “[var functionName = function() {} vs function functionName() {}](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname)” (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname).  Though it is not truly a question, it is clear to see that the question is about declaring functions.  It is short and clearly conveys a message.  There are tags associated with the question, such as the javascript tag I used to locate it, that provide more insight.  More information is given in the description portion of the question.  The asker provides general code snippets that help viewers understand exactly what they are looking at.  The response the asker is looking for is which style of creating a function may be more helpful, and/or pros and cons with the goal of cleaning up code.  

The top answers associated with this question are just as clear and helpful. The answers helped to understand the difference between a function expression and a function declaration.  A link was also provided on the topic of hoisting to further aid the explanation on expression vs. declaration.  Answer posts support each other and build upon one another.  They are supported overall by a large number of upvotes from the community.

\# Stupid Question

`	`Next we look at “No Response from jsonArray request”(<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44899821/no-response-from-jsonarray-request>).  The asker uses one sentence to try to explain their problem, then says “Help!” and posts a ridiculous amount of code.  The asker could have been much more specific, in the way they are asking their question, and in the way they are presenting the code to be debugged.  The question just appears very messy so it’s no wonder there are so many downvotes on it.  The one answer to this question is just as messy and full of what appears to be unnecessary code lines. Looks like when it comes to stackOverflow, what goes around comes around.
