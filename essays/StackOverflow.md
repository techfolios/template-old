As a student learning new languages and different programming styles, the overflow of information can easily be overwhelming. Thankfully society has graced us with much experience and has shared exstensive knowledge with the young and new pioneers in the coding realm. This has lead to a meeting ground for beginners to dine in the knowledge that willing veterans divuldge. But how to actually get the said veterans to reveal their secrects is the real question.

As suggested by Raymond and Moen in ["How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), while using the opensource community to learning programming, there is a said right and wrong way to going about asking for help. Different to searching google for a question, these questions are posted to some type of a forum or asked directly to specific users. In their personal opinion on behalf of the other master teir programmers, veterans like themselves prefer questions that promote a sense of challenge and stimulation. Basically, they don't want to answer questions which suggest that the inquirer didn't already investigate. 

To first take a closer look into this, here is a link to a [Poor Asked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33661063/i-need-help-making-a-for-loop-in-java-to-make-random-lines-appear-in-an-applet) question. In this example, a user asks for help on a specific problem. The details are limited to one line of question and coding attempt. The introductory code seems very basic and barely scratches the surface so much that the very few potential assistants require the user to repost more information, detail and the user's actual attempt at his failed coding attempt. With a little more back and forth between the user and one particularly helpful programmer, his question is finally answered, but not as optimal as it could be due to limited code example from the original post.

Instead, here is a link to a user who showed the [Proper Attempt](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7217013/java-event-dispatching-thread-explanation) to trying to ask a question. This user showed their concern by scouring for multiple sources, an explanation of their current understanding, a submission of relevant code, and multiple pre-emptive questions which flow off of one another. THIS is someone that anyone would want to answer a question for. Without any additional back and forth questioning, a user replies to the best of his knowledge and provides redirection and additional resources in addition to his well composed response. 

Although it is easy to simply post a question to a forum sight such as StackOverflow, it would seem to be more beneficial to both community and user. As seen by the second post, I would also agree that it feels more rewarding to help someone who has already tried and actually wants to learn something rather than simply look for someone else to provide the answer, like that of the first post. Personally, as I continue my seemingly endless journey of how to program correctly, I will look towards the lessons of Raymond and Moen and continue the practices that I am trying to build  which happends to be the same lessons they try to encourage.
