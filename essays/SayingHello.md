# Hello World

A "Hello is a beginning of something new. Relationships start with a "Hello". Usually they are followed by an introduction and hopefully with a smile. A "Hello" can start a conversation or it can start a passion. In my intoductory class to computer science, our first assignment was to make our computer say "Hello World!". Mostly all introductory classes do it, and it may seem really simple but to me it filled me with excitement. Being able to tell a computer to do anything I want and it will do it is incredible. When I am programming I feel as if I am talking to the computer and when the program runs exactly as I expect it to I feel like the computer understood me. 

# My future

Of course, not everybody can "talk" to a computer. Programming a hard language to learn so in the future I would love to be that translator. I strive to be an IT specialist in the future. I would love to know more about computer and programming so I can help other people use that information. Even if I do not become an IT specialist, being able to know how to develop software, web, and applications is fun! I have always wanted to try video game development because I am able to tell the computer to make a whole different kind of world! That is amazing! 

Overall, I may sound like a big nerd to others but programming is something I am passionate about. There is more to programming then just sitting down and typing 0's and 1's. Developing software requires communicating with people, being able to understand others and being able to understand the computer as well. I plan to develop these skills so I can help others in the future. I may develope a program that may change everyday life, or I might be able to tell companies what type of products to use in their buisness. There are so much I can do to help this world now and in the future, and to think that all of this started with just one Hello.
