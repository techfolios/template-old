   I enter the movie theater back in 2008 to watch the first Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr. The character was notorious for being a legendary inventor with an eye for the future. I was immediately gung-ho on all the cool gadgets and Jarvis was what really blew my mind away. 
   Even though I was a tech enthusiast I didn't dedicate time into creating anything because when I looked up how such technologies worked, I was completely lost. I was not up for the insane engineering curriculum when I looked up on how to become an engineer. After years of switching majors, I finally realized that even though I had ample opportunities to graduate with a degree other than engineering, I was not passionate about what I was learning. After a year of learning and studying "like an engineer", I was ready and excited to start programming and creating technologies that I found interest in. 
   After some classes, I enjoyed coding very much and sometime I would have to sit in front of the screen trying to figure out why a code didn't work and better yet, why it works "spontaneously". The trials and struggle that I went through was completely worth it. I am hoping to learn more about web application, database architecture and development approach, workflow map, Photoshop design, HTML, CSS and adding AJAX interactivity.
